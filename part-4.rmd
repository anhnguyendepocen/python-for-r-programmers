## Topics for this part

### Some Data Cleaning with Pandas

### The Pricing Wine

## Importing Data with Pandas

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import plotnine
from plotnine import *

plotnine.options.figure_size = (2, 1)

wine = pd.read_csv("winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")

wine = wine.drop('Unnamed: 0', axis = 1)

# How many rows?
wine.shape[0]

# What are the column names?
wine.keys()
```

## Dealing with Missing Data

```{python}
# How many missing countries?
wine[ ~ wine['country'].isnull() ].shape[0]

# Drop them
wine = wine[ ~ wine['country'].isnull() ]
```

## How many wineries and countries?
```{python}
# How many unique wineries?
len(wine['winery'].unique())

# How many countries?
len(wine['country'].unique())
```

## Visualizing Country Counts
```{python}

# Make country categorical, ordered by count.
country_list = wine['country'].value_counts().index.tolist()
country_cat = pd.Categorical(wine['country'], categories = country_list)
wine = wine.assign(country_cat = country_cat)

# Where are the wines from?
(ggplot(wine, aes(x = "country_cat")) +
    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(rotation=270, hjust=1)) +
    geom_histogram())
```

## How much do they cost?

```{python}
(ggplot(wine, aes(x = "price")) +
    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(rotation=270, hjust=1)) +
    geom_histogram())
```

## Switching to the log scale

```{python}
# Let's log. Get rid of NaN's first.
wine = wine[ ~ wine['price'].isna() ]
wine = wine.assign(log_price = np.log(wine['price']))

(ggplot(wine, aes(x = "log_price")) +
    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(rotation=270, hjust=1)) +
    geom_histogram())
```

## Wine Varieties

```{python}
# How many types are represented?
variety_count = pd.value_counts(wine.variety.values)

# How many varieties have been rated at least 1000 times?
np.sum(variety_count > 1000)
variety_count = variety_count[variety_count > 1000]

wine = wine[wine.variety.isin(variety_count.keys())]
```

## Wine Rating

```{python}
# What is the average number points per variety?
(wine.points.groupby(wine.variety).describe().sort_values("mean",
  ascending = False))

# How many tasters?
taster_counts = pd.value_counts(wine['taster_name'].values)
```

## Subsetting / Filtering

```{python}
# Let's get the individuals with at least 1000 tastings.
keep_taster = taster_counts[taster_counts > 1000]

wine = wine[wine.taster_name.isin(keep_tasters)]

(wine.points.groupby(wine.taster_name).describe().sort_values("mean",
  ascending = False))
```

## A Linear Regression

```{python}
# What is the assocation between price and points?
import statsmodels.formula.api as sm

fit = sm.ols(formula = "points ~ price", data = wine).fit()
fit.summary()

```

## A Slightly More Complicated Linear Regression

```{python}
# Is there an interaction with variety?
fit = sm.ols(formula = "points ~ log_price + variety + price:variety", \
  data = wine).fit()
fit.summary()
np.sort(wine.variety.unique())
```

## Which wines are the best buy?

```{python}
# Which wine is the most overpriced?
wine = wine.assign(resid = fit.resid)
wine = wine.assign(fitted = fit.fittedvalues)
under_priced = wine[wine.resid == np.max(wine.resid)]
under_priced.keys()
under_priced.values
```

## Which ones are the worst?

```{python}
over_priced = wine[wine.resid == np.min(wine.resid)]
over_priced.values
```

## Wrapping up.
