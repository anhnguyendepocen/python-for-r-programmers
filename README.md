# Course Materials for Bootstrap Learning Python with R

This repository houses all of the materials to be presented at the 
day long course "Bootstrap Learning Python with R," which is presented
as a day-long course at the 2019 Joint Statistical Meetings, put on
by the American Statistical Association.

# The Course

The course is scheduled from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM on July 27, 2019 
in room 405 of the Colorado Convention Center. All materials will be posted to 
this Github repository as it becomes available.

## Format

We will be running Python and R code during the class and students are 
expected to interact with code, the instructor, and each other. We will 
building software and constructing analyses, and it is expected that 
students will bring a laptop with software installed (see Pre-course
Preparation) and participate in this process.
