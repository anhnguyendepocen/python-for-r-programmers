This repository houses all of the materials to be presented at the 
day long course "Bootstrap Learning Python with R," which is presented
as a day-long course at the 2019 Joint Statistical Meetings, put on
by the American Statistical Association.

# The Course

This was a full day course, broken down into four parts.

1. [Background and Basics](part-1.html)
2. [Digging Deeper into Python Programming Constructs](part-2.html)
3. [Building Software Systems  using Object-Oriented Programming](part-3.html)
4. [Working with Data](part-4.html)

# Materials

The slides were generated using RMarkdown in RStudio. Other setup scripts are
included along with a single Python file to reproduce the data analysis in 
Part 4.
